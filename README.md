# Smart Student Performance Analytics System

## Problem Statement
Managing and analyzing student performance data manually is time-consuming and inefficient. This project aims to simplify student data management and perform basic performance analysis using Python and SQL.

## Overview
Smart Student Performance Analytics System is a Python-based console application designed to manage and analyze student performance data efficiently. The system integrates Python with an SQLite database for data storage, retrieval, and basic analytics.

## Features
- Add student records
- View student performance details
- Store data using SQLite database
- Menu-driven console application
- Clean and modular code structure

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SQLite (SQL Database)
- Git & GitHub
